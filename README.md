# Multitape Deterministic Turing Machine Simulator


Multitape Deterministic Turing Machine Simulator is a C++ program used to simulate the operation of a multitape deterministic turing machine simulator on a given string. All the details are fully explained on this website [https://ptc-nju.github.io/](https://ptc-nju.github.io/ "https://ptc-nju.github.io/").

To run the program, enter the turing-project folder and execute the command  `make compile` on command line. Then, you shall see an executable file named turing in the same folder. Type `./turing --help` for more detailes. And for a quick start, type `./turing eg.tm 100010001` and you will see the result : true.

Please do remember to strictly follow the predefined format when you are writing the tm files. Technically, anything that happened due to a wrongly desigend tm file, is considered an undefined behavior.
